# **Assignment: My First Server**

Create and host a simple Node.js server that returns a basic HTML page.

**Requirements**

- Create a new node project using `npm init -y` (make sure it creates a `package.json` file)
- Update your `package.json` to include a `start` script, and install dependencies `http` and `fs`
- Update the `server.js` file and write javascript to create a new server hosted on `localhost:3000`
- Create a basic webpage in `index.html` page (can be Halloween themed!). Note: You page can just include HTML+CSS. Optionally, you can make it interactive with Javascript. Place all your CSS and JS in `index.html`.
- Host your project as a Web Service on Render
